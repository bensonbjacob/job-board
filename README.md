This project is a comprehensive job listing web application called "Yellowhammer Tech Jobs". It's built with a modern tech stack including React, TypeScript, and Next.js, and it's designed to connect Alabama's tech talent with relevant job opportunities.

The application's front-end is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing the Next.js framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and creating API routes. The project uses a component-based architecture, with reusable components such as `Badge`, `Footer`, `FormSubmitButton`, `JobFilterSidebar`, `JobListItem`, `JobPage`, and `JobResults` found in the [`src/components`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22src%2Fcomponents%22%5D "src/components") directory. The application's global styles are managed with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

The back-end of the application is handled by Prisma, an open-source database toolkit. The Prisma schema is defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22prisma%2Fschema.prisma%22%5D "prisma/schema.prisma"), and the database is seeded with placeholder data using scripts found in the [`scripts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22scripts%22%5D "scripts") directory.

The project follows best practices for code quality and formatting, with ESLint for linting, Prettier for code formatting, and a comprehensive [`.gitignore`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.gitignore%22%5D ".gitignore") file for version control. The project is also configured for deployment on Vercel, a popular platform for deploying Next.js applications.

Overall, this project showcases a full-stack skill set, with a focus on modern front-end technologies and back-end database management. It's a great example of a real-world application built with some of the most popular and cutting-edge technologies in the web development industry today.
